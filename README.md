# Project: Automated Financial Data Scraping for Lead Generation

During my internship at Dynamic Intelligence Asia (dIA) (July - October 2024), I independently developed and implemented an automated web scraping workflow. This project, which extended beyond my core prompt engineering duties, was designed to extract crucial financial data from diverse online sources. The solution significantly enhanced the sales team's ability to efficiently identify and qualify potential leads, directly contributing to their outreach strategies.
